I'm currently a Master student in Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, specializing in Computational Data Science. I received my bachelor degree of Computer Software in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. 

I'm interested in **Machine Learning**, **Data Science and Business Intelligence**. You can expect to see some posts about these topics in my blog in the future. 

### Professional Experience

**Hulu, Beijing, China** Full-stack web developer intern, Jul.2013 – Oct.2013

I worked inside the Recommendation team and developed an internal tool in collaboration with other team members. My job included but not limited to developing complex front end pages, processing various types of data and implement analytic APIs.

**SigmaLove(Qi-Ming-He-Xin) LLC, Beijing, China** Core developer(member of earliest founder team), Oct. 2013 – May. 2014

I joined this start-up team at a very early stage and together with other team members we'd built the initial system and refined it to a smooth workflow. Due to personal reasons I left the team, but I wish they'll go well in the future.
